Amazing location, just a short walk to the High St & main shopping bit. Really enjoyed our stay, and the manager of our room was nice enough to allow us to keep our luggage in the rooms for the morning Of check out so we didnâ€™t have to run around Cheltenham with all of our bags and cases! Will definitely return and stay here again!',
