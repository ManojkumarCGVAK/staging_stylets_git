					<h3>General</h3>
					<p>
						These booking conditions set out the basis upon which
						the accommodation reservations are accepted for clients
						(“You”, “Your party”) by Markey Student Property Ltd,
						trading as StayLets (“Us”, “We”, “Our”).
					</p>
					<h3>
						Acceptance of Terms and Conditions / Contract of Hire
					</h3>
					<p>
						You will be deemed to have confirmed your booking, and
						accepted these terms and conditions, either 72 hours
						after We send you your Booking Confirmation email or
						when You send confirmation that you have received the
						Booking Confirmation email or You make payment of all or
						part of the rental charge, whichever is the earliest.
					</p>
					<h3>Confirmation of Booking</h3>
					<p>
						All booking details are confirmed by Us via a Booking
						Confirmation email and are deemed to have been accepted
						by You and Your Party unless, within 24 hours of the
						sending of the Booking Confirmation email, You inform us
						by email that You wish to alter of cancel the booking
						arrangements.
					</p>
					<h3>Prices</h3>
					<p>
						All prices are quoted in UK Pounds Sterling and, unless
						otherwise specified, the prices quoted are not subject
						to UK VAT. All prices are based on costs prevailing at
						the time of quotation and may be subject to change.
					</p>
					<h3>Price Bands</h3>
					<p>
						The price band charged depends on the length of your
						stay. If your stay reduces in length resulting in your
						stay falling into a different price band you will be
						required to pay the difference in the two rates from the
						start of your stay.
					</p>
					<h3>Payment Procedure</h3>
					<p>
						When a booking is made fewer than 28 days prior to the
						arrival date, the Full rent is required to confirm the
						reservation. When a booking is made 28 days, or more,
						prior to the arrival date, an Initial Payment of 25% is
						required to confirm the reservation. Where an Initial
						Payment has been made the Final Payment of 75% is due to
						be paid 28 days before arrival. If We do not receive
						full payment by this time, the booking may be cancelled
						and the Initial Payment forfeited. You may also be
						liable for the balance of the total rent and for any
						other costs involved in the attempt to re-let the
						accommodation.
					</p>
					<h3>Payment by Credit/Debit Cards</h3>
					<p>
						We do not hold any credit or debit card information on
						our systems.

					<h3>Use of Apartments</h3>
					<p>
						It is forbidden to use our apartments for parties or
						gatherings where occupants of neighbouring apartments
						might be disturbed. If, on arrival, it is felt you are
						intending to use the apartments for such an event you
						may be refused entrance. If it is discovered that you
						are holding such an event after arrival you will be
						required to leave immediately. In such circumstances, We
						are not obliged to provide or locate alternative
						accommodation. The proportion of refund is at Our
						discretion.
					</p>
					<h3>Facilities and Services</h3>
					<p>
						All apartments are fully furnished to a high standard
						and include a kitchen fully equipped with appliances,
						cutlery, crockery, and kitchen utensils. A Broadband
						Internet connection is provided at all locations. There
						is no charge for normal use, as described in our{' '}
						<strong>Fair Usage Policy</strong>, of this facility. If
						a loss of connection occurs We will endeavour to get
						reconnected as quickly as possible but We cannot be held
						liable for any losses resulting from the loss of
						connection. Unless otherwise specified, the prices
						quoted for all serviced apartments include utilities and
						taxes.. All linen and towels are included. Any extra
						charges are at the management’s discretion.
					</p>
					<h3>Fair Usage Policy</h3>
					<p>
						Broadband usage is subject to what We consider to be a
						fair use. This is sufficient for all normal activities,
						e.g. web browsing and emailing, but may be exceeded if
						there is a significant amount of activities such as
						video streaming. Please note: any illegal internet
						activity, e.g. peer-to-peer file sharing, will result in
						the internet access being closed down for the duration
						of your stay.
					</p>
					<h3>Cancellation by You</h3>
					<p>
						All notification of cancellation must be made in writing
						by email to Us. You are responsible for ensuring the
						notification has been received. When notification is
						received more than 7 prior to the first date cancelled
						(for stays over 6 nights) or 48 hrs (for stays under 6
						nights), all payments received from the client are
						refunded. When notification is received at any time less
						than the above periods, the full cost of the cancelled
						period is forfeit. We strongly recommend that all
						clients obtain appropriate travel and personal insurance
						cover to cover these charges in the event of a
						cancellation.
					</p>
					<h3>Alteration by You</h3>
					<p>
						If you wish to alter your booking (e.g. change the dates
						of your stay or the accommodation requested), we will
						use all our reasonable efforts to comply with your
						request, however we cannot guarantee that we will be
						able to do so and we accept no liability for any loss,
						damage or additional expense that may be incurred in
						that circumstance. Delayed arrivals and early departures
						will be treated as cancellation, even if additional
						nights are added to the end or beginning of the stay,
						and so will be subject to the cancellation charge if the
						change is made 48 hrs or less prior to the first date
						changed.
					</p>
					<h3>Cancellation by Us</h3>
					<p>
						In exceptional circumstances we may find it necessary to
						cancel your booking and if so, we shall make all
						reasonable efforts to offer a suitable alternative. If
						this is not acceptable, and assuming the cancellation is
						not as a result of events beyond our reasonable control,
						which shall include but not be limited to events such as
						war, civil strife, terrorist activity, labour disputes,
						natural or man-made disaster, fire, flood, and adverse
						weather conditions, we will refund any sum you have paid
						to us which shall constitute full and final settlement
						of any liability we may have to you as a result of such
						cancellation. This does not affect your statutory
						rights. More specifically, nothing in these conditions
						shall restrict our liability for death or personal
						injury caused by our negligence, or for fraudulent
						misrepresentation.
					</p>
					<h3>Alteration by Us</h3>
					<p>
						While every effort is made to adhere to the apartment
						location, postal number and price stated in a booking,
						We reserve the right to vary the location and postal
						number of the apartment at any time until check-in and
						vary the total price at any time before receiving the
						final payment from the client. Any variation will be
						communicated to the client in writing by email. On
						receiving notification, the client has forty-eight hours
						to communicate non-acceptance of the variation
						described. If no such communication is received, the
						client is assumed to have accepted the variation. If
						communication of non-acceptance is received within
						forty-eight hours, all paid funds will be returned to
						the client without any deduction.
					</p>
					<h3>Number of Occupants</h3>
					<p>
						You are responsible for ensuring that the apartment is
						not occupied by more people than is stated on your
						Booking Confirmation email, which is set to the number
						of beds in the apartment. We reserve the right to refuse
						admittance to the apartment if we feel this condition is
						likely to be breached. In this case no paid funds will
						be returned. The apartment cannot be re-let/sublet to
						any other group/party without the written approval of
						Us.
					</p>
					<h3>Check-in and Check-out</h3>
					<p>
						The rules for check-in and check-out are set by Us. All
						apartments are usually available for occupation after
						3.00pm on the Day of arrival. Keys are made available by
						remote access system, or secure lock box on site. All
						apartments must be vacated by 11am on the day of
						departure and keys must be left in the key boxes they
						were retrieved from. Arrangements can be made for a
						later checkout but this is subject to prior arrangement.
						If there is any delay in vacating the apartment beyond
						the agreed time a full day’s rental is charged to You.
					</p>
					<h3>Damage to Apartment</h3>
					<p>
						You are responsible for taking all reasonable care of
						the property and its contents. The property and all
						equipment, utensils, furniture etc. must be left clean
						and tidy at the end of the hire period. Except in the
						case of normal wear and tear the hirer will be
						responsible for making good any damage to the apartment
						or its contents, which has occurred due to negligence,
						wilful damage or irresponsible behaviour on the part of
						those occupying the apartment or their guests. Such
						damage must be reported, without delay, to our local
						representatives. The cost of the repair or replacement
						must be agreed with, and paid to, Us. You are
						responsible for ensuring that no person staying or
						visiting the apartment during your stay will suffer
						anything to be done which would endanger the policy of
						our insurers in respect of the apartment and its
						contents which might make the same void or voidable.
					</p>
					<h3>Termination by Us</h3>
					<p>
						We have the right to terminate a booking at any time on
						the grounds of abuse to staff or other guests,
						mistreatment of the apartment or criminal activity on
						the part of those occupying the apartment or their
						guests.
					</p>
					<h3>Injury or Loss</h3>
					<p>
						We cannot be held responsible for any personal injury,
						loss or damage to personal effects howsoever arising at
						the accommodation. Neither We, nor our representatives,
						can be held responsible for any circumstances beyond our
						control including, but not limited to, mechanical
						breakdown, illness or failure of any public service
						supply.
					</p>
					<h3>Rights of Access</h3>
					<p>
						Our representatives and subcontractors have the right of
						access to the property at any time, with due regard to
						the convenience of You, for the purpose of inspection of
						the property and to carry out any essential repair or
						maintenance work.
					</p>
					<h3>Pets</h3>
					<p>
						Regrettably no pets of any kind are permitted under any
						circumstances. You are liable for any infringement of
						this rule by Your occupiers.
					</p>
					<h3>Information</h3>
					<p>
						All information supplied by Us, is given in good faith
						and is based on information available at the time. All
						reasonable measures have been taken to ensure the
						accuracy of any statement made either in writing or
						otherwise, but We are not liable for any variation
						however caused.

						submitted after the completion of the rental period.

						of accommodation with Us, the Courts in England shall
						have sole jurisdiction on such arising matters and
						English law prevalent at the time shall be applied at
						the times.

					<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
					<p>

						expenses incurred if your booking needs to be altered or
						cancelled or we are unable to perform our contractual
						obligations as a result of events beyond our reasonable
						control, which shall include but not be limited to
						events such as war, civil strife, terrorist activity,
						labour disputes, natural or man-made disaster, fire,
						flood, and adverse weather conditions.
					</p>
